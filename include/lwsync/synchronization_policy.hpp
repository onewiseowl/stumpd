/** @brief Lwsync library provides lock&wait based patterns to build synchronization
  * on concurrent environment.
  *
  * Lwsync library provides only two patterns to build lock&wait based synchronization
  * on concurrent environment. But in most cases it is fully enough to have those two patterns
  * to build lock&wait based concurrent application. All patterns can be mapped to any system
  * synchronization facilities. By default they are mapped on boost::recursive_mutex and
  * boost::condition ones so that Lwsync is portable by default if boost library is available.
  *
  * If boost library is not available LWSYNC_HAS_NO_BOOST macro must be defined and non-default
  * synchronization policies should be used.
