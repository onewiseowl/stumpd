   /** @brief Implementation of a monitor pattern.
     *
     * Monitor is a kind of critical resource that allows one not only to synchronize
     * resource in concurrent environment but also allows to wait when resource
     * becomes to some defined state.
     *
     * @param Resource Type of resource to guard.
     * @param Sync_policy Critical resource synchronization policy.
     *
     * @note There is no necessity in partial template instantiation for references.
     * Monitor pattern just will inherit critical_resource<Resource&, Sync_policy> and all
     * will work well.
     *
     * @note critical resource pattern can be used with monitor synchronization
     * policy, but not vice versa. One can't instantiate monitor pattern with synchronization policy for
     * critical resource.
